# TilmeldingTilRestVaccine

A short script that signs me up for the daily left over COVID shots once a day @ 10AM

### Description

* Uses node-cron for running the job @10
* Shelljs for executing the script
* Puppeteer for chromium automation

### Installing

* Upload to desired hosting service and run npm install
* Remember to change the information in the script in order to sign yourself up and not me :-)
